# ElectionTracker
The purpose of this project is to keep track of 5 candidates. We then, calculate the total votes of all 5 candidates and calculate the average of the total.

The purpose of this project is to understand how we could utilize Arrays and ArrayLists in our programs. 

In addition, we need to understand how traversals work as well as how replacement methods work. 

This program allowed us to challenge ourselves by learning new concepts.

Area for improvement: 

At first, I struggled to understand how replacement methods worked. I needed to constantly revise the lesson and my notes until I understood. 

What I liked: 

I enjoyed understanding how traversals and replacement methods worked as well as how they can be used in a program.
